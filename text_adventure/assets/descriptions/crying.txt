You sob uncontrolably. 

Looking at the violin brings back memories of your childhood music lessons. You had played violin with your sister until her tragic death in a carriage spill. You close your eyes briefly in pain, remembering rainy days and how the soft tones she played on the piano wrapped like a silky blanket around the melodies you strung together slowly like individual pearls.

You hear Clara playing as if it were yesterday. Your sobs gradually subside.
