You awaken at dusk in the hall of the top floor of your boarding house, a building cobbled together over several centuries, with only vague memories of the night before, soreness radiating from an odd mark on your arm. Last night, hearing strange music coming from the room of the only other boarder on this floor, you had crept into the hall. Strange music, not weird or modern, but deeply unsettling. The music seemed to abide by all the conventions, but the effect on you upon hearing it was like that on the eyes when seeing the photographic negative of an image. Misplaced and jarring, it was as if the silence were louder than the tones, pressing through and imposing itself on your consciousness. It was this roaring of silence that was the last thing you rememberedâ€¦

Coming to, you hear no sign of the musician. This could be your chance to enter the bedroom and look around.
